Welcome
=======
Tomotok provides inversions methods and framework easing computation of inversion for tokamak data, i.e. assuming toroidal symmetry.
It aims at providing multiple inversion algorithms to ease tomography usage by the fusion community. The package is released as open-source for a better transparency of the code, for reproducibility of the results as well as to allow a broader user usage.
